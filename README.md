# Identifying-Damaged-Car-Parts-with-Vertex-AutoML-Vision

Vertex AI brings together the Google Cloud services for building ML under one, unified UI and API. In Vertex AI, you can now easily train and compare models using AutoML or custom code training and all your models are stored in one central model repository. These models can now be deployed to the same endpoints on Vertex AI.

# Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to:

1. Upload a labeled dataset to Cloud Storage using a CSV file and connect it to Vertex AI as a Managed Dataset.
   
2. Inspect uploaded images to ensure there are no errors in your dataset.
   
3. Kick off an AutoML Vision model training job.
   
4. Request predictions from a hosted model trained on the same dataset.
